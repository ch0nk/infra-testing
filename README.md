# network-infra-testing

This Repo contains a variety of tools I've found, tweaked, modified, or written, related to low-level testing and validation of network infrastructure related items. My intent is to add more items as I come across them, and make improvements to suit a variety of needs.

Forks and PRs are welcome!

## Port Checker

port_checker.py is intended to run periodically to test whether or not a given port is listening/available on a given host.
